description: "Deploy and run your first background coding agent in less than 5 minutes."

<Warning>
  WARNING:

  As of 5/13/2025, the steps below are currently a work in progress and not expected to work. The documentation is to demonstrate what will be available in the coming days.

  Items still under development:

  1. Detect agent configurations in code & labels added to issues
  2. Store background sessions for debugging with 'qckfx assist'

  If you have any questions, please reach out to [chris.wood@qckfx.com](mailto:chris.wood@qckfx.com).
</Warning>

You can use `npx @qckfx/background init` to build and deploy your first background agent. This command creates a .qckfx/ folder in your repo with the configurations needed for a background agent to work on any issue labeled 'qckfx' in your repo.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Before you begin, you‚Äôll need to install Node.js and NPM. We highly recommend using [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js versions, and running on Node version 18\+.

    <Info>
      qckfx background agents work with any language repository, we just recommend using npm for ease of setup.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Agent in Existing Repository">
    Move into the directory of an existing repository where you want to install the agent.

    ```
    cd my-existing-project
    ```

    Configure our default issue-crunching agent

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npx @qckfx/background init
        ```

        You will see the following appear:

        ```
        Created .qckfx/agents/default.json
        Created .qckfx/triggers/label-qckfx.json
        
        ‚úÖ  qckfx bootstrap complete!
        Next step: install the qckfx GitHub App üëâ  https://github.com/apps/qckfx
        After installation, add the ‚Äúqckfx‚Äù label to an issue to fire the agent.
        ```

        And finally, it's important that you push these changes to your main branch on github.

        ```bash
        git add .qckfx && \
        git commit -m "Added my first qckfx background agent!" && \
        git push origin main
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Github App">
    Install the qckfx Github App so that we can receive notifications when your triggers are fired and let your agents access your code.

    Visit https://github.com/apps/qckfx to install.

    <Info>
      Your code is never stored on our servers, we just grant the agent access while it is running and then it is removed from our servers. If you would like to explore self-hosting, please reachout to [chris.wood@qckfx.com](mailto:chris.wood@qckfx.com).
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Issue with the 'qckfx' Label">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Using Github CLI">
        If you already have the Github CLI installed you can test this out without leaving your terminal.

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Create 'qckfx' Issue Label">
            ```bash
            gh label create "qckfx" --color 1B9847 --description "Automate with qckfx background agent"
            ```
          </Step>
          <Step title="Create New Issue with 'qckfx' Label">
            ```bash
            gh issue create --title "Create qckfx.md" --body "Explore the repository and create a top-level qckfx.md file filled with all of the tips someone working on this codebase should know." --label "qckfx"
            ```
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Using Github Website">
        We just need to create the label once on the website and then we can apply it to any issue we'd like.

        ![From the Github Issues page, click the 'Labels' button in the top right-hand corner.](/images/Screenshot2025-05-13at12.32.01AM.png)

        ![From the issue/labels page that we're now on, click the 'New Label' button in the top right hand corner.](/images/Screenshot2025-05-13at12.32.17AM.png)

        ![Fill in 'Label Name' as qckfx, 'Description' as 'Automate with qckfx background agent', and 'Color' as '#1B9847'. Then press the 'Create Label' button on the right side of the screen.](/images/Screenshot2025-05-13at12.33.05AM.png)

        ![You should now see a new 'qckfx' label in your list of labels.](/images/Screenshot2025-05-13at12.33.27AM.png)

        Once the label is created, just create a new issue and assign it the 'qckfx' label.
