title: "Assist"
description: "Assist is what you may normally think of as a Coding Agent. It works similarly to Claude Code or OpenAI's Codex, but it operates in the browser."

We view this tool as the best way to debug your agent and to prototype new agents. Our recommended approach is to run as many background agent sessions as possible to maximize throughput and leverage Assist to rewind bad changes and commandeer agent sessions after the fact.

You can also, of course, use it as a copilot and work on new features alongside the AI inside of Assist. It has some nice features for that, including tool previews, rollbacks, and the ability to switch LLM models at any time during the chat.

Assist is completely open-source and has been since day 1. We have a lot more ideas for how to grow this tool in the future, but we encourage you to fork it and make it your own as well\!
